# Legacy version
The original CLI for Iterum. The original vision included a CLI that could create different types of repositories for code, data, and pipelines. The tool would automatically create Git repositories and such. These features became out of scope due to time and a different focus of the project. Now they live in the legacy branch, maybe they can be useful some day.
